# undergraduate-thesis-radio-analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes radio emission data from the JUNO spacecraft,
focusing on time-frequency spectrograms and characteristic emission
patterns.


## My Role
- Processed raw radio data from the JUNO spacecraft
- Generated time-frequency spectrograms using IDL
- Analyzed emission patterns and identified characteristic structures

## Tools
- IDL
- Excel

## Results
- Below are example spectrogram outputs generated for selected observation periods.

## Data
The data used in this project originates from radio emission data
of the JUNO spacecraft, which is distributed through the
NASA Planetary Data System (PDS).

The specific dataset used in this analysis was provided by my
undergraduate thesis supervisor, who had previously collected and
archived the data locally for research purposes.

## Note: 
The original dataset is very large and requires a significant
amount of time and storage to download. Therefore, the raw data is
not included in this repository.

## Acknowledgements
This project was developed as part of my coursework / undergraduate research.
I would like to thank my undergraduate thesis supervisor, Prof. Riabov, for helpful guidance and feedback.
